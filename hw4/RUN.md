# HW4 submission readme

## Reproducing results

Each question's commands are placed within q1 - q5_bonus.sh. Simply run these shell scripts to start experiments for each question.

## Reproducing graphs

For question 1, the plots are generated in the experiment results. For question 2, the plot was a screenshot presented on Tensorboard by visiting `python3 -m tensorboard.main --logdir <directory>`.

For questions 3 to 5, ex3_viz.py to ex5_viz.py take in predefined log directories and put generated figures into a fig_out folder with the necessary plots, legends, and caption.
